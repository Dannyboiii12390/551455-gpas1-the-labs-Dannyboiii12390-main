# Your reflection
As you develop your scene, you should reflect on your progress by editing this document in each of the sections below. You should include information that makes it clear what you have implemented and demonstrates your understanding of the concepts and techniques that you have applied.
# Implement a MyVector object that passes all the provided tests.
Your reflection
# Implement a MyMatrix object that passes all the provided tests.
Your reflection
# Use the MyMatrix and MyVector objects to implement transformations (translate, rotate, scale) in your scene.
Your reflection
# Implement a Scene Graph to store and execute your transformations and drawings.
Your reflection
# Has produced a physically based, processor independent simulation using one or more integration methods.
Your reflection
# Can collide objects with other stationary and moving objects, and axis aligned and non axis aligned cuboids. Includes spatial partitioning for efficiency.
Your reflection
# Collisions produce correct elastic and/or inelastic response with axis aligned and non axis aligned cuboids and with other objects of the same or different masses.
